I am not a maid. I run a shop in the food court.    
Students must tidy their own litter, but I always cleaned up after the three entitled brats that wanted to bribe for their degrees. 
Privileged Sonja used her kid to justify buying a degree because it was "too hard" to study and care for her child. Sonja reeked of entitlement. 
Henrico was a lazy narcissist who was so jealous of his brother 'the doctor' that he wanted to buy a first-class degree to outshine him. 
Money-hungry Zenzile wanted a degree NOW to find a high-flying job to fund her lifestyle. Zenzile was greedy.  
Thankfully Government is committed to fighting corruption because their video changed Zenzile's life, and mine...
The Government video showed the power of believing in yourself by showcasing the mindsets of successful township entrepreneurs. These individuals had welcomed the challenges of their struggles and setbacks, using them as opportunities to learn, re-strategize and grow, emerging stronger and smarter with each failure.
The video forced Zenzile to confront her self-belief. She knew she was smart and determined, but somewhere she'd stopped believing in herself. Zenzile's fear of failure drew her toward corruption but taking the easy way out would rob her of opportunities to grow. The Government video helped Zenzile say no to the bribe because it was time to stop making excuses for herself. 
The Government video didn't only impact Zenzile's life it helped mine too... because their table has been spotless ever since.
