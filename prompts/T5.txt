I am not a maid. I run a shop in the food court.    
Most students put their litter in the bin, but I always cleaned up after the three entitled brats that wanted to bribe for their degrees. 
Privileged Sonja used her kid to justify buying a degree because it was "too hard" to study and care for her child. Sonja reeked of entitlement. 
Henrico was a lazy narcissist who was so jealous of his brother 'the doctor' that he wanted to buy a first-class degree to outshine him. 
Money-hungry Zenzile wanted a degree NOW to find a high-flying job to fund her lifestyle. Zenzile was greedy.  
Thankfully Government is committed to fighting corruption because their video changed Zenzile's life and mine...
The Government video showed how township communities were working together to fight corruption. The more people said NO to corruption the better, happier & safer their had communities become. Their collective action improved their community because their lives were so interconnected.
Having grown up in a similar community Zenzile felt proud of these people, but she felt ashamed knowing she was on the wrong side, the side working against them. Zenzile felt disconnected from herself and others. While she longed to end her suffering, she realised it couldn't be at the expense of her community. She needed to play her part in society and that meant listening to the Government and saying no to the bribe. 
The Government video didn't only impact Zenzile's life it helped mine too... because their table has been spotless ever since.
