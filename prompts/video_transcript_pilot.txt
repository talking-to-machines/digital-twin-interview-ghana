Next we will show you a short video on the importance of early childhood vaccinations for measles. This is a video lasting less than 60 seconds that was produced by the English National Health Service.
“It’s really important to remember how effective vaccines are. They do prevent 5000 deaths a year in the UK and 100,000 hospitalizations. We’ll see babies at eight weeks, 12 weeks and at 16 weeks, we give them different vaccinations against a range of illnesses, and this offers the best protection. At one year, the child will have their first MMR vaccine, and so that gives them a lot of protection. And then at three years, four months, they have the second the booster MMR, and then that’s them for life, protected from measles, mumps and rubella. It really is of the utmost importance that you take us up on this offer and get your child vaccinated and keep everyone safe.”
