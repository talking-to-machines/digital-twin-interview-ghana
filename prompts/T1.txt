Weight gain is the sum of little things that add up over time: choosing the escalator instead of the stairs, eating two helpings of dinner, and so on, and so on. Ever wonder why you're winded or your joints ache, and blame it on your age? Well, think about your weight. Imagine carrying a 10-pound bag everywhere you go. Just 10 pounds adds more than 30 pounds of force to your knees. So those achy knees might mean you need better habits. By realizing you're overweight and by taking control now, you may lower the risk of developing serious health problems, like heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones and some cancers. Losing just 5 percent of your body weight may also decrease the stress you're putting on your body. That means doing more of the things you enjoy, without the aches and pains. It's the little things that make up the weight gain, and it's the little things that will help take it back off. Wouldn't you like to drop the weight and stop picking up more? Obesity happens one pound at a time. So does preventing it.
