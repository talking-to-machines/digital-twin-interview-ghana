I am not a maid. I run a shop in the food court.    
Students must tidy their own litter, but I always cleaned up after those three students that wanted to bribe for their degrees. 
Sonja was desperate to better provide for her child. She wanted to buy a degree because she struggled to manage her responsibilities and study.
Henrico wanted to make his parents proud like his brother the doctor had, but he doubted his ability to do it without buying a degree.
Zenzile was tired of being poor. She thought buying a degree would get her a good job quickly. Zenzile wanted a better life.
Thankfully Government is committed to fighting corruption because their video changed Zenzile's life, and mine...
The Government video showed the power of believing in yourself by showcasing the mindsets of successful township entrepreneurs. These individuals had welcomed the challenges of their struggles and setbacks, using them as opportunities to learn, re-strategize and grow, emerging stronger and smarter with each failure.
The video forced Zenzile to confront her self-belief. She knew she was smart and determined, but somewhere she'd stopped believing in herself. Zenzile's fear of failure drew her toward corruption but taking the easy way out would rob her of opportunities to grow. The Government video helped Zenzile say no to the bribe because it was time to stop making excuses for herself. 
The Government video didn't only impact Zenzile's life it helped mine too... because their table has been spotless ever since.
