assistant: [poses an interview question]
user: [offers an initial response]
assistant: [asks follow-up questions]

1. Can you tell me about your thoughts and feelings when you hear people talk about vaccinations for things like measles or smallpox?
2. Have you ever come across information—online or in conversation—that made you doubt the safety or purpose of vaccines? What did you think about it?
3. Do you think there are groups or organizations that were trying to influence people’s decisions about vaccines? If so, what do you think their goals were?
4. When you think about decisions around getting vaccinated—whether for yourself or for your children—what factors come to mind?
