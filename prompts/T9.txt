hey guys I've received a lot of messages asking me to do a video about University and so guess what I'm gonna do a quick video to update everyone about my week at University. This is my friend Sonia. 
This girl is lit lit okay but listen girl needs to learn to sit because she's gonna burn herself out. Henrico appears out of nowhere. 
He's a really cool guy though and pretty cute too but tends to drown me in Game of Thrones fan theories. 
Guys, I haven't even watched the series so we're chatting about the week when Henrico interrupts with this theory about the three-eyed Raven. 
Guys, I don't know what he was talking about! Sonia whispered to me that she wants to get another Samosa. 
Enrico gets awkward because he thinks we're talking about him he gives this weird smile because I don't know maybe he thinks Sonja likes him and maybe he likes her. 
I get weird because the situation is weird and ah guys it just becomes stressful, I decided to take a walk because I also got things going on in my life. 
So don't come here and put your weird energies in my cup you know? 
Anyways I do some walking. Henrico's a great guy but also a bit of an introvert. 
What am I saying he's a huge introvert he's literally sitting in a dark cave here he watches way too much Game of Thrones obsessed with all that ran Stark three-eyed Crow stuff and then Sonia is just the complete opposite. 
Girl is busy, honey and also a bit isolated there where she lives, rocking at old school with that windmill. 
Anyways I've been walking for ages y'all are texting me non-stop.  
I'm sweating you're sweating those are the circumstances that I found myself in when I said yes to your messages about making a video by the way anyway thank you for watching my video
