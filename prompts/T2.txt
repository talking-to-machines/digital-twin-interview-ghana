I am not a maid. I run a shop in the food court.     
Most students put their litter in the bin, but I always cleaned up after those three students who wanted to bribe for their degrees.
Sonja was desperate to better provide for her child. She wanted to buy a degree because she struggled to manage her responsibilities and study.
Henrico wanted to make his parents proud like his brother the doctor had, but he doubted his ability to do it without buying a degree.
Zenzile was tired of being poor. She thought buying a degree would get her a good job quickly. Zenzile wanted a better life. 
Thankfully NGO's are committed to fighting corruption because their video changed Zenzile's life, and mine...
The NGO video showed how township communities were working together to fight corruption. The more people said NO to corruption the better, happier & safer their had communities become. Their collective action improved their community because their lives were so interconnected.
Having grown up in a similar community Zenzile felt proud of these people, but she felt ashamed knowing she was on the wrong side, the side working against them. Zenzile felt disconnected from herself and others. While she longed to end her suffering, she realised it couldn't be at the expense of her community. She needed to play her part in society and that meant listening to the NGO and saying no to the bribe. 
The NGO's video didn't only impact Zenzile's life it helped mine too... because their table has been spotless ever since.
